Overview:
---------
This boilerplate helps you getting started with your Blaskan child theme.
You should always use a child theme when customizing Blaskan. Otherwise your 
changes will be overridden each time you update Blaskan to a newer version.

Instructions:
-------------
1. Make sure you have previously downloaded the Blaskan theme.
2. Rename the child theme folder to the name that you want to use.
   E.g. "blaskanmatt".
3. Open style.css and change the Theme Name value to the human friendly name for
   your theme. E.g. "Blaskan Matt". You may also optionally change the Theme
   URI, Description, Author, Author URI and Version values.

That's it! Now go activate your child theme.
